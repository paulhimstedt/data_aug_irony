I saw someone suggest he is trying to remove some older content to put future larger pieces up as a pay what you want with no barrier, but for the time being, this is a bad look imo. Even the magazines I like and want to support I can often get dirt cheap with digital offerings and Dwelling of Duels is doing quite well with a pay what you want format, no need for this shit.  If it is just to get a taste of some more space era Progressing and the other 29 episodes stay out there, I’ll likely bite the bullet and pay for it. But i’m in a decent position and if I’m apprehensive about fully supporting, I don’t see the Patreon growing, if it weren’t for some really awesome gaming content I’d have left that Patreon quite a while ago and I am be this close with this one."

It's Covid, I  wondered why none of the tills or bars are cashless, even though a girl using the same till an hour after me had been. No PPE, except the old man serving in the breakfast room. It's also the little things that impress me. Friends came to stay 10 minutes from our room, when the popped to see me at the hotel, the guard wouldn't let them into the building, despite my protests that they came from here and helped bring things to us. They had to walk round the airport hotel to say the same thing to another guard and even then they would be allowed into reception. Great first impression for guests I'm hoping to bring next week....
